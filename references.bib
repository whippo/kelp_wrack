	abstract = {Warming ocean temperatures have been linked to kelp forest declines worldwide, and elevated temperatures can act synergistically with other local stressors to exacerbate kelp loss. The bull kelp Nereocystis luetkeana is the primary canopy-­forming kelp species in the Salish Sea, where it is declining in areas with elevated summer water temperatures and low nutrient concentrations. To determine the interactive effects of these two stressors on microscopic stages of N. luetkeana, we cultured gametophytes and microscopic sporophytes from seven different Salish Sea populations across seven different temperatures (10–­22°C) and two nitrogen concentrations. The thermal tolerance of microscopic gametophytes and sporophytes was similar across populations, and high temperatures were more stressful than low nitrogen levels. Additional nitrogen did not improve gametophyte or sporophyte survival at high temperatures. Gametophyte densities were highest between 10 and 16°C and declined sharply at 18°C, and temperatures of 20 and 22°C were lethal. The window for successful sporophyte production was narrower, peaking at 10–­14°C. Across all populations, the warmest temperature at which sporophytes were produced was 16 or 18°C, but sporophyte densities were 78\% lower at 16°C and 95\% lower at 18°C compared to cooler temperatures. In the field, bottom temperatures revealed that the thermal limits of gametophyte growth (18°C) and sporophyte production (16–­18°C) were reached during the summer at multiple sites. Prolonged exposure of bull kelp gametophytes to temperatures of 16°C and above could limit reproduction, and therefore recruitment, of adult kelp sporophytes.},

	abstract = {Kelp habitats contribute to marine productivity and diversity, making understanding the constraints on their distribution important. In the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Alaria esculenta occupies a subset of Saccharina latissima’s range. Since tolerance to sedimentation by early life stages was suggested to cause this contrasting distribution, we tested the influence of sediment levels on spore attachment and development. For both species, the pro­ portion of attached spores that developed decreased with increasing sediment. However, spore attachment and gametophyte density increased with sediment concentration but only for Saccharina. At the maximum sediment level examined, spore attachment and gametophyte densities of the two species were similar, contrary to the idea that sediment effects on early life stages explain differences in adult distribution. Further investigation, partic­ ularly with higher sediment loads, is required to confirm this conclusion. As turbidity is increasing globally, understanding the mechanisms underpinning changes in seaweed distribution will facilitate appropriate localscale management.},

	abstract = {Ecosystem-based management is predicated on the multifaceted and interconnected nature of biological communities and of human impacts on them. Species targeted by humans for extraction can have multiple ecological functions and provide societies with a variety of services, and management practices must recognize, accommodate, and balance these diverse values. Similarly, multiple human activities can affect biological resources, and the separate and inter­active effects of these activities must be understood to develop effective management plans. Species of large brown algae in the order Laminariales (kelps) are prominent members of shallow subtidal marine communities associated with temperate coastlines worldwide. They provide a diversity of ecosystem services, perhaps most notably the fuelling of primary production and detritus-based food webs and the creation of biogenic habitat that increases local species diversity and abundance. Species of kelp have also been collected for a variety of purposes throughout the history of human habitation of these coastlines. The bull kelp, Nereocystis luetkeana, provides a clear example of how the development of sustainable harvest policies depends critically on an understanding of the morphological, physiological, life-history, demographic, and ecological traits of a species. However, for Nereocystis as well as many other marine species, critical biological data are lacking. This review summarizes current knowledge of bull kelp biology, ecological functions and services, and past and ongoing management practices and concludes by recommending research directions for moving toward an ecosystem-based approach to managing this and similarly important kelps in shallow temperate rocky reef ecosystems.},

              Nereocystis
              abundance declined sharply in 2014 and has yet to recover. While abiotic and biotic stressors were present prior to 2014, the population collapse highlights the need for a better understanding of how environmental conditions impact
              Nereocystis
              . In this study, we used a newly-developed, satellite-based dataset of bull kelp abundance, proxied by canopy cover over 20 years, to test the hypothesis that winter oceanographic conditions determine summer
              Nereocystis
              canopy cover. For the years before the collapse (1991 through 2013), wintertime ocean conditions, synthesized in a Multivariate Ocean Climate Indicator (MOCI), were indeed a good predictor of summer

              canopy cover (R
              2

South of Point Arena, California, winter ocean conditions had slightly lower explanatory power than north of Point Arena, also reflective of spring upwelling-driven nutrient entrainment. Results suggest that the

              collapse in summer 2014, and for kelp north of Point Arena, a further decline in 2015. Importantly, environmental models do not predict changes in kelp after 2015, suggesting biotic factors suppressed kelp recovery, most likely extreme sea urchin herbivory. Conditions during winter, a season that is often overlooked in studies of biophysical interactions, are useful for predicting summer
              Nereocystis
              kelp forest canopy cover, and will be useful in supporting kelp restoration actions in California and perhaps elsewhere in the world.},

              ), which serves as major biogenic habitat in the Salish Sea of Washington State. We hypothesized that (i) juvenile
              N. luetkeana
              would exhibit a seasonal appearance as a cohort in the spring and (ii) competition for space would be more limiting than propagules (spores) to recruitment at sites adjacent to established

Eliminating macroalgal competitors (“clearing”) influenced the appearance of recruits more than enhancement of propagules in the spring. An improved understanding of factors regulating the seasonal appearance of new
