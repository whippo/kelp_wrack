METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION,

Description of methods used for collection/generation of data:,"All intact, mature sporophytes with a holdfast, stipe, bulb and blades were measured on the beach.  The length of stipe was measured to the nearest cm.  The circumference of the bulb was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm, and the diameter was determined using the OmniCircumference Calculator on the Web.  The widest sterile or fertile blade was measured to  the nearest 0.1 cm.  The number of intact sori, releasing sori and abscised sori on the widest fertile blade was recorded.  The algal epiphytes, barnacles and hydroids on the stipe were recorded.  For wet weight biomass, the stipe was excised at 15 cm below the blade attachment. The blade was washed in ocean or creek water, drained and placed in a slingand weighed using a Modern Step Hanging Scale."

Missing data codes,
Code/symbol: ,none
Definition: ,"In the stipe column, none means that no kelp were found on the beach."
,
Code/symbol: ,none
Definition: ,"In the epiphyte columns, none means that there were no epiphytes observed."
,
Code/symbol: ,NA
Value labels: ,NA means that no measurements were taken because no kelp was present.
,
Code/symbol: ,nd
Value labels: ,"nd means that although data existed, it was not measured, or the tip of blade was missing and number of abscised sori could not be determined. "
