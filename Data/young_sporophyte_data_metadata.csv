Description of methods used for collection/generation of data:,METHODS
<include links or references to publications or other documentation containing experimental ,
"design or protocols used in data collection> All intact, individual young sporophytes and clusters  ",
"of young sporophytes with holdfasts, stipes, bulbs and blades were collected and brought to the  ",
lab.  The diameter of some holdfasts were measured to the nearest mm.  Because of the ,
"elasticity of the stipe, its length was measured tothe nearest 0.5 cm.  The diameter of the bulb",
was measured with a caliper to the nearest mm.  The width of some of the widest blades were,
measured to the nearest mm.,
