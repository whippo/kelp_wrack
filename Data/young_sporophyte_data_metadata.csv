METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION,
_______________________________________,
,
Description of methods used for collection/generation of data:,"All intact, individual young sporophytes and clusters  of young sporophytes with holdfasts, stipes, bulbs and blades were collected and brought to the  lab.  The diameter of some holdfasts were measured to the nearest mm.  Because of the elasticity of the stipe, its length was measured to the nearest 0.5 cm.  The diameter of the bulb was measured with a caliper to the nearest mm.  The width of some of the widest blades were measured to the nearest mm."
